### Still To Do

Although this game is fully playable I would like to add some more features.

+ Trivia
+ Locations - Like rooms in your house. This could be user entered.
+ Player Names
+ Player Colors - This is something that should be added sooner then later because not everyone who plays this will be a guy and a girl and currently the colors do reflect this a bit.
+ A web version of the game. I could see each player using their phone. That way trivia questions could be asked without the other player seeing the answers. Theres some cool things that could be done with this.
